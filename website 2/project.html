        <h3>Calculator</h3>
        <p>I don't have a picture of the first calculator I developed. That's why I used the second one I created.</p>
        <ul>
          <li style="margin-bottom:2rem;";>I used Pycharm for my first project.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:2rem;";>I faced many problems when working on my first project. It was not easy, but I kept motivated and determined, which is why I finished it.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:2rem;";>Basically, the calculator that I created can solve any problem or equation.</li>
